Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
I was tasked with creating a simple inventory application to track items within a warehouse.
Brief Summary of Requiremnts:
1. A login screen that supported login and account creation for new users.
2. An inventory screen using a grid to display inventory items.
3. A database to store inventory items and user credentials.
4. User should be able to add, delete, and update inventory item information.
5. User can opt in or out of SMS notifications.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
Screens:
1. Login
2. Inventory
   
Features:
1. A simple form for logging in and creating accounts that includes fields for username and password. I included hints in these fields to provide clarity. I added a forgot username and forgot password link under these fields to provide ease of use. Clearly labeled buttons were included here for login and creating account.
2. Inventory grid columns contain titles for clarity. Name and quantity columns are editable for adding and updating items. Each row contains a save button, for adding and updating items, and a delete button, for deleting a specific item.

Besides the above screens and features, I also included a settings screen with a toggle switch for users to opt in or out of SMS notifications. Each screen has a header at the top. The settings and inventory screens also have navigation bars at the bottom, for easy navigation. The app has a cohesive design, using similar color schemes and typography throughout. The design is successful because the features mentioned provide an easily navigated, clear, and cohesive application.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
My approach was to first create the layouts that contained all the components I would need to meet user requirements. From there I tried to implement those requiremnts by doing the activity code for each screen individually. I built and used the emulator throughout the process to ensure things worked correctly. I think this iterative process would be a good approach on future projects.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
To ensure code was functional I used the emulator. This process is important because it revealed bugs even when code was error free. There were many times I ran the application in the emulator and the app would stop running even though my code had no errors.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
My initial planning was somewhat ambitious. Due to lack of experience and time, additional features I wanted to include were not feasible, I had to re-evaluate and shift to a design that still met requirements, but may not be as robust as I first invisioned.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I think the most succesful components from my mobile app design were my use of buttons and toggle switches. I feel they were well placed and executed to provide the most user friendly design within my capabilities.
